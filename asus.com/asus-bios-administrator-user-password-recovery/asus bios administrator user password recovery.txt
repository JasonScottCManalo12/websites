Go into the BIOS setup (often this is by pressing F2, F12 or some other key while booting) and search the menus for any reference to SecureBoot, or Legacy vs UEFI boot modes. These or mouse support all indicate that your BIOS is not a BIOS at all but UEFI.

Alternatively, under Windows, press <Windows key>-R and in the box type msinfo32 and press Enter. Under System, look for any mention of BIOS Mode. It may indicate UEFI, indicating you have UEFI and you are booted in UEFI mode, or Legacy, meaning your UEFI has booted the machine in BIOS-emulation mode. If not reported, you have an old fashioned BIOS.



ESP maintenance
To examine the ESP, under Windows, run a command prompt as an administrator then run the command

mountvol x: /s
Your x drive will now be the ESP, but only for that command prompt and any child processes. You can examine it with the usual cd and dir DOS commands, or to examine with filemanager, type

explorer

As mentioned earlier, there are alternative BIOS key options to F2. For some laptop models, it’s recommended that you use the ‘Delete Key’ or the ‘Insert Key. However, there are some rare cases where Asus laptop users have used the F10 key.

Just like the F2 key, using other keys requires you to press and hold the keys until the BIOS window is displayed; hence it sheds light on why you should hold down the keys before switching on the power- which is an effective approach.

Besides that, Microsoft added further options for Asus users using Windows 10 as the operating system. If you fall in this category, you should perhaps cease looking for the BIOS key and instead use an alternative approach. Simply click on ‘start’ – on the windows icon, Select ‘Settings’ and choose the ‘Update and Security option. Afterward, select the ‘Recovery’ option and scroll down to ‘Advanced startup.’ By now, you will realize that this action restarts your laptop and provides you with an option to ‘troubleshoot.’ This will surely give you access to UEFI firmware and BIOS settings.

How to recover a forgotten BIOS password on a Dell desktop
BIOS passwords cannot be recovered. If you have forgotten one of the passwords that is set in the BIOS, resetting the CMOS or NVRAM helps reset the BIOS to factory default settings and remove the passwords from the BIOS.

WARNING: Clearing the CMOS or NVRAM using a jumper resets the passwords in the BIOS. This includes the BIOS user password, admin password, and HDD password. This does not include any other passwords such as Windows logon, online accounts, and so on.
NOTE: The location of the PSWD jumper will vary between different Dell desktops. For more information about the location of jumpers, see the User Manual of the Dell desktop.
Before you begin, follow the Safety Precautions When Working with Electronic and Electrical Equipment.
Turn off the computer and disconnect the power cable from the computer.
Locate the password reset jumper (PSWD) on the system board.
Remove the jumper plug from the password jumper-pins.
Power on without the jumper plug to clear the password.
Wait until the desktop is loaded and then shut down the computer and replace the jumper plug in its original location.
